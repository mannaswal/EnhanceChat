## Notification Sound

Add a notification sound file here:
- `notification.mp3` (preferred)
- Or `notification.wav` (fallback)

The extension will try to play `notification.mp3` first, then fall back to `notification.wav` if the MP3 file is not available.

You can download free notification sounds from:
- freesound.org
- zapsplat.com
- Or use any personal notification sound file
